  <h2>HTML Overview</h2>
  <p>
    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language,
    a markup language that defines the structure and meaning of web documents.

    HTML does not handle logic;
    its core purpose is to accurately represent the meaning of content.
  </p>

  <h3>Role of HTML</h3>
  <p>
    HTML clearly distinguishes the structure of content,
    such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.
  </p>

    Using semantic tags significantly improves
    accessibility and SEO quality.

    Tags such as header, main, section, article, and footer
    constitute the semantic structure.
