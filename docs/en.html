<h2>[User Guide] BESPOKE Jet Bot AI+</h2>

<section>
  <h2>01. Introduction: Hardware Architecture</h2>
  <p> The BESPOKE Jet Bot AI+ is more than just a home appliance; it is an intelligent hybrid robot platform designed to
    analyze the structure and significance of your living space. The exterior is engineered to balance durability with
    aesthetic excellence, fitting seamlessly into any environment. </p>
  <p> The core philosophy behind its design is the logical "structuring" of physical space. Every component serves a
    specific functional purpose, creating a perfect user experience layout the moment the main body docks with the Clean
    Station. </p>

  <h3>Role of Core Modules</h3>
  <p> The Jet Bot AI+ operates through distinct modules, including LiDAR sensors, brush assemblies, and suction motors.
    This modularity allows users to intuitively monitor the device's status and path without navigating complex
    settings. </p>

  <h3>Semantic Cleaning</h3>
  <p> Beyond simple obstacle avoidance, the device defines the "context" of a room. It identifies bedrooms, living
    rooms, and kitchens autonomously, applying optimized cleaning algorithms for each specific environment. This
    contextual awareness significantly enhances operational efficiency and hygiene quality. </p>

  <h4>Intelligent Space Tagging</h4>
  <p> The system identifies floor materials (carpet, hardwood, marble) and furniture types (sofas, dining tables, pet
    bowls) to assign semantic tags. This creates a smart structure that prioritizes cleaning in high-traffic or heavily
    soiled areas. </p>

  <h2>02. Visual Guide: Design and Layout Systems</h2>
  <p> The design philosophy of the BESPOKE series reflects the essence of visual style even atop complex structures. Its
    minimal flat design harmonizes with any interior, elevating the value of the user's space. </p>

  <h3>Style Components</h3>
  <p> The harmony of the glass-textured top panel, metallic brush guards, and LED status indicators is intentionally
    designed based on functional priority. Users can instantly recognize the device's status through simple light
    patterns and colors. </p>

  <h3>Adaptive Layout System</h3>
  <p> The Jet Bot AI+ reconfigures its operational layout in real-time based on furniture placement and threshold
    heights. It activates a multi-dimensional spatial exploration system that goes beyond linear forward/backward
    movements. </p>

  <h4>Flex Control (Precision Movement)</h4>
  <p> In narrow areas such as corridors or between chair legs, the device switches to a specialized precision layout
    mode. Sensors specialized in alignment and spacing control allow for meticulous cleaning along walls and edges. </p>

  <h4>Grid Mapping (Omnidirectional Navigation)</h4>
  <p> In large, open areas like living rooms, the device switches to high-speed cleaning based on a 2D Grid Map. It is
    an efficient system that finds optimal paths even among furniture arranged like complex UI components. </p>

  <h2>03. Smart Control: AI Logic and Connectivity</h2>
  <p> The embedded AI processor breathes life into the static machine, providing dynamic movement and intelligent logic.
    It doesn't just move; it learns user habits and proactively adapts to environmental changes. </p>

  <h3>SmartThings Integration</h3>
  <p> Control the device remotely via the SmartThings app interface. Users can interact with the virtual map rendered on
    the screen to select specific zones and adjust cleaning modes or schedules in real-time. </p>

  <h3>Modular Code System</h3>
  <p> The software architecture of the Jet Bot AI+ adopts a modular structure where functions are clearly separated.
    This allows firmware updates to enhance specific features or fix errors without interrupting the entire system's
    operation. </p>

  <h4>Sustainable Updates</h4>
  <p> Whenever new cleaning modes or pet care features are added, we provide update packages that maximize system
    readability and maintainability. Users always experience the latest intelligent UI. </p>

  <h2>04. User Interface: Navigation and Search UX</h2>
  <p> The user interface of the Jet Bot AI+ is designed with information delivery and efficient navigation as top
    priorities. It empowers users to utilize the device's vast array of features intuitively. </p>

  <h3>Smart TOC (Table of Contents)</h3>
  <p> The Smart TOC within the cleaning report allows users to grasp cleaning results by space at a glance. Users can
    quickly select a specific room (e.g., Living Room, Master Bedroom) to jump directly to the before-and-after video
    and data for that location. </p>

  <h3>Intelligent Search Experience</h3>
  <p> It reduces the effort required to find specific information within vast cleaning logs and settings. Voice
    recognition and in-app search functions significantly lower the fatigue associated with device management. </p>

  <h4>Short-Command System</h4>
  <p> Commands like "Clean the living room" or "Return to charger" bypass complex menu navigation, providing a high-end
    user experience. This ensures rapid operability, much like using keyboard shortcuts for professional software. </p>
